# php-snake-cli
<b>HOW TO RUN</b>
<br>
1. Install ncurses
```properties
git clone https://github.com/OOPS-ORG-PHP/mod_ncurses.git
cd mod_ncurses
phpize
./configure
make
make install
```
The php.ini will need to be adjusted, and an extension=extname.so line will need to be added before the extension can be used.

<br>
2. Run it
<br>
```properties
php snake.php
```
